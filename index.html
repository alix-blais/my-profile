			<h2>Dance 💃</h2>
			<p>I love dancing since 10 years now. It really frees me up to express myself without any censorship. It's a real pleasure for me, that's why it's my passion.</p>

			<h2>Travel ✈️</h2>
			<p>Coming from a multicultural family, travel is very important to me. I have a particular attraction for foreign cultures and I love to discover new monuments, new ways of thinking, new cultures...</p>

			<h2>Cooking 🧁</h2>
			<p>When I was little, I often baked cakes at weekends with my mother. Since then, it has become a habit and I cook dishes or cakes every weekend. I find that cooking helps to relieve the pressure and it feels good in times of stress.</p>
